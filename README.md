### 1. Framework of Students' Grievance System

The system framework is organized into two main sections:

1. **Students Section:**
   - **User-Friendly Interface:** Includes a well-designed dashboard, account settings, lodge complaints, and complaint history for seamless navigation.
   - **Transparent Interaction:** Empowers students to engage with the system effortlessly.

2. **Administrator Section:**
   - **Hierarchical Structure:** Divided into Main Admin, Department Admin, College Admin, and University Admin, each with specific responsibilities.
   - **Efficient Management:** Enables administrators to handle and respond to student complaints effectively.

This structure ensures a user-centric design for students and a hierarchical administrative setup for efficient system management.
